This is an application that helps you to make code reviews. There are alot of applications that can do this for you, but almost all of them are build to be collaborative and connected to a server or installed on a server and accessed through a webclient. 
So in order to use them you have to be connected to the internet, and you have to have a server where you can install the server part of the tool, and if you want to use those tools in work related projects, you have to have permission from the IT-department to install the tool on the server.

**Stanalone Review** is build to be entirely standalone and disconnected. If you have the file or files you want to review locally and you have **Standalone Review** installed, you can make comments to the file, thats it.
